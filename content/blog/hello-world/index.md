Hey I'm an absent-minded genius!

## WHO AM I

- daydreamer
- thinker
- recruiter
- brother
- biggest sports fan alive
- baller
- traveler
- wanderer
- people lover
- all things GoT and ASoIaF
- Cobra Kai 4 life
- amateur cyclist
- wannabe dev
- every day is Christmas

I want to add gamer, but I absolutely _suck_ at gaming. Unless it's *_Elder Scrolls_* of course. Who hasn't wasted hundreds of hours on Skyrim living vicariously through a cat-like humanoid who goes around killing and stealing without remorse?
